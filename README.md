## üîç Project Overview

This Python project performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on school accessibility data by neighborhood using a dataset loaded from a CSV file. It cleans the data, encodes categorical neighborhoods numerically, applies PCA with scaling, and visualizes the results with a scatter plot including PCA component vectors.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

* Reads and cleans dataset from CSV with automatic encoding handling (UTF-8 / ISO-8859-1)
* Selects relevant columns: Neighborhood name, Number of accessible rooms, Number of special education classes
* Encodes neighborhood names into numeric codes for PCA
* Standardizes data before PCA
* Calculates covariance matrix, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors
* Performs PCA with 2 principal components
* Visualizes PCA results with neighborhood coloring and component vectors on scatter plot

---

## üì¶ Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* pandas
* numpy
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

1. Set the path to your dataset CSV in the `caminho` variable in the script or main block.
2. Run the script.
3. The program will:

   * Load and clean the dataset
   * Perform PCA on selected features
   * Plot the PCA scatter plot with components

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
PCAAcessibilidade.py            # Main Python script/class performing PCA and visualization
DataFrame/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DFmicrodados2021.csv        # Example input dataset (not included)
```

---

## üìù Notes

* The script automatically handles CSV encoding issues by trying UTF-8 first, then ISO-8859-1.
* PCA components are plotted as arrows on the scatter plot for interpretability.
* Neighborhood names are displayed as color-coded groups.
